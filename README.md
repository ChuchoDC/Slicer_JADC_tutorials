# Welcome to my first 3D Slicer tutorial

You will see how to show the 3D cube surrounding your model and how to enable/disable the letters that indicate the orientation label.

## Activate the cube
1.- Go to the model view. On the upper part of that window you will find a row of four small icons. Click on the first one, and a small pop-up window will appear.

2. In this new pop-up window, look for the small eye icon on the third row **(1)**. Click on it and you will see a new drop down menu.  Select the 3D cube option **(2)**, and it will show the cube wrapping your model.

3. If you also want to show the orientation markers, look in the same pop-up menu of the previous step, and click on the 3D axis label.

In the end, you will have an image similar to the following one:

You will notice that there is no correspondence between the labels and the sides of your model. We will fix this in the next tutorial.
